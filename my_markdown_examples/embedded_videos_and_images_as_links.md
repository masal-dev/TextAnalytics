# Video Embedding
How to embed videos (and in general use image as linked button)

Videos cannot be really embedded as images, but is often used to put an image as the video link description.

So an image is embedded, then is used as description of the link with this syntax:

\[ \!\[Image alternate Text](image_URL "image tooltip") ](video_URL)

This can be used to link anything using an image as button.

When linking YouTube videos can be useful to use a thumbnail that is a frame of the video and that can be obtained YouTube at:

_https://img.youtube.com/vi/\<video-id\>/\<quality\>.jpg_


**\<video-id>** is generally the one in the video URL like:

_https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\<video-id\>_

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xkGBLNCfZk


**\<quality>** can be:

hqdefault (high)

mqdefault or 0 (medium/default)

sddefault (standard/low)

maxresdefault (Full HD, when available?)
