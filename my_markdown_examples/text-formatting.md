Writing some example of markdown:

some characters, attached to the word or sentence at beginning and end give style: _ * ~

like i.e.: __bold__ and also _italic_

They can be both written with _ or *: *single* is _italic_ and **double** is __bold__

It's possible to also use both: _**bold and italic**_

~~Double tilde is instead used for strikethrough~~

> A quote block, similar to the emails reply use the same character of old emails, the angle closing bracket: >

# Header 1
Headers need just a pound sign and a space at beginning of line and finish with new line.
All headers automatically create an **anchor** to them that can be used in links.

## Header 2
Increasing the number of pounds the headers become progressively littler (until 6!)
